#  WindowsForm cannot find the constructor on type xxxx.

## Context

Recently, when designing desktop pages, I encountered several scenarios where the underlying logic of the pages was the same. So I specifically set up a Base Page for the User Controls (UCs) to inherit from. Since the pages are actually very similar, I finally decided not to use reference and directly use inheritance.

Let A (UC_3Dswitch_CalibrationFileManagement) inherit from B (UC_3Dswitch_FileManagementBase).

## Error Message

There are no compilation errors, but when I switch to Design mode, I encounter the following "Type not found" error.

## Solution

> **Declares a parameterless constructor and an injected constructor**

```csharp

// Declares a parameterless constructor
public UC_3Dswitch_FileManagementBase()
{

}
public UC_3Dswitch_FileManagementBase(AppSetting appSetting) 
{
	ProductLineDataPath = appSetting.ProductLineDataPath;
	SNFolderNameLength = appSetting.SNFolderNameLength;
	InitializeComponent();
}
```

Due to the injected AppSetting object in the original Base setting, the aforementioned loading error occurred. It seems that the Designer mode, when used with Control objects, defaults to setting an empty constructor.
