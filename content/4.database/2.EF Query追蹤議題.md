#  Issues with large-scale create processing time and query tracking.

## 一、Performance bottlenecks in bulk data creation

### a.Context

We faced a performance bottleneck when inserting approximately 15,000 records using Entity Framework. Due to the cost associated with EF Bulk Insert, we opted for the standard DbContext.Add approach, which resulted in an insertion time of nearly 30 seconds.

### [Root Casue](https://docs.microsoft.com/zh-tw/ef/ef6/saving/change-tracking/auto-detect-changes)

When modifying EF POCO entities, the DetectChanges() method is invoked to compare the new and old values of all properties in the entry set. This can lead to significant performance degradation when dealing with large datasets. The following methods will trigger DetectChanges():

 - DbSet.Find
 - DbSet.Local
 - DbSet.Add
 - DbSet.AddRange
 - DbSet.Remove
 - DbSet.RemoveRange
 - DbSet.Attach
 - DbContext.SaveChanges
 - DbCoNtext.GetValidationErrors
 - DbContext.Entry
 - DbChangeTracker.Entries

 ### b.Solution
Based on the aforementioned reasons, there are two primary methods to reduce the creation time for large datasets:

 - Using AddRange : 
     - By employing AddRange to insert all data in a single operation, we can significantly reduce the time spent invoking DetectChanges() for each individual Add operation.

 - Setting Configuration.AutoDetectChangesEnabled to false : 
     - Disabling automatic change detection by setting AutoDetectChangesEnabled to false before adding entities, and then re-enabling it afterward, can also improve performance.

### c.Test Result
The actual test results for accessing 12,544 records are as follows:
 - Add : 34s
 - AddRange : 13s
 - AutoDetectChangesEnabled fasle : 13s

## 二、[Query tracking issue](https://docs.microsoft.com/zh-tw/ef/core/querying/tracking#tracking-queries)

To address the long processing time for bulk creation operations in EF, I also investigated the query aspect. I found that EF queries have a default tracking design. Here's a brief testing code snippet:

![Testing Code](images/03/02/001.png)

The operation steps are as follows:

Step 1: Context 1 retrieves Mario's data.
Step 2: Context 2 adds a new Test record.
Step 3: Context 1 modifies Mario's data to Jack. 

The results are as follows:

![Result](images/03/02/002.png)

It's observed that Context1 detects an increase in the number of records, but Context2 still reads the old value for the Name.

Since Context2 fetches data from the cache, the second query doesn't hit the database, resulting in the retrieval of the old value. If we modify the second query in Context2 to...

```=
dbContext2.TestRecord.AsNoTracking().SingleOrDefault(x => x.Id == 1).Name
```

Under these circumstances, the retrieved value will be the updated Name "Jack" as modified by Context1. Consequently, in read-only contexts, employing untracked queries can enhance query efficiency. (Empirical verification pending)
