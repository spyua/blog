# Quick Tips for Testing Server Disk Read Speed Using MSSQL Commands

## Read Speed

Select a database and execute the BACKUP DATABASE command. By setting the backup to read-only (no write operations), you can obtain the read speed value.

```sql
BACKUP DATABASE [FUXIN_CPL] TO DISK ='NULL' WITH COPY_ONLY
```

The following figure shows the result: a read speed of 180 MB/sec.

## Write Speed

``` sql 
BACKUP DATABASE [FUXIN_CPL] TO DISK ='C:\TEST.BAK' WITH COPY_ONLY
```

You'll get a read/write speed of 153 megabytes per second at this point.

The read/write speed is 153 MB per second. Given that there are 688 pages, each 8KB in size (totaling 688 * 8.0 / 1024 = 5.375 MB), and the write time difference is 0.035 - 0.03 = 0.005 seconds, we can calculate the write time.

5.375M/0.005 = 1075M
