# Refactoring 00 : Quick Review Notes
 
 Reorganizing study notes for better code understanding

## Bad Code Smell Item List

- **Duplicated Code** : Identical or similar code appears in multiple places, increasing the burden of maintenance and updates.

Scenario: Two methods in different classes perform the same calculation.

```java

// Class A
public class Order {
    public double calculateTotalPrice(List<Item> items) {
        double total = 0;
        for (Item item : items) {
            total += item.getPrice() * item.getQuantity();
        }
        return total;
    }
}

// Class B
public class Invoice {
    public double calculateTotalPrice(List<Item> items) {
        double total = 0;
        for (Item item : items) {
            total += item.getPrice() * item.getQuantity();
        }
        return total;
    }
}

```

- **Long Method** : A method (function) is overly long, making it difficult to understand and maintain; it should be broken down into smaller functional units.

Scenario: A method handles multiple responsibilities and is too lengthy.

```java
public void processOrder(Order order) {
    // Validate order
    // Calculate totals
    // Apply discounts
    // Update inventory
    // Send notifications
    // Generate invoice
    // ... (method continues)
}
```

- **Large Class** : A class contains too many responsibilities and functionalities, violating the Single Responsibility Principle; it should be split into smaller, more focused classes.

Scenario: A class manages orders, customers, inventory, and reporting.

```java
public class StoreManager {
    // Order management methods
    // Customer management methods
    // Inventory management methods
    // Reporting methods
    // ... (class continues)
}
```

- **Long Parameter List** : A single module needs frequent modifications for different reasons, leading to maintenance difficulties and violating the Single Responsibility Principle.

Scenario: A method requires numerous parameters to perform its task.

```java
public void createUser(String firstName, String lastName, String email, String phone,
                       String address, String city, String state, String zipCode) {
    // Method implementation
}
```

- **Divergent Change** : A single module needs frequent modifications for different reasons, leading to maintenance difficulties and violating the Single Responsibility Principle.

Scenario: A single class changes for multiple, unrelated reasons.

```java
public class Employee {
    // Fields and methods related to employee data

    // Methods related to payroll calculations
    // Methods related to employee scheduling
    // Methods related to performance reviews
}
```

- **Shotgun Surgery** : A small change requires modifications in multiple classes or modules, increasing the risk of errors and maintenance costs.

Scenario: Changing a database field name requires updates in many classes.

```java
// Changing "userName" to "username" affects multiple classes
public class UserDAO {
    public User findByUserName(String userName) { /* ... */ }
}

public class AuthenticationService {
    public boolean authenticate(String userName, String password) { /* ... */ }
}

public class AuditService {
    public void logLogin(String userName) { /* ... */ }
}
```

- **Feature Envy** : A method excessively uses data or functions from other classes; it should be moved to the related class.

Scenario: A method accesses the data of another class excessively.

```java
public class SalaryCalculator {
    public double calculateSalary(Employee employee) {
        double base = employee.getBaseSalary();
        double bonus = employee.getPerformanceBonus();
        double tax = employee.getTaxRate();
        return (base + bonus) * (1 - tax);
    }
}
```

- **Data Clumps** : A group of related data frequently appears together; it should be encapsulated into a new class or structure.

Scenario: Multiple methods use the same group of parameters.

```java
public void printAddress(String street, String city, String state, String zip) { /* ... */ }

public void validateAddress(String street, String city, String state, String zip) { /* ... */ }

public void saveAddress(String street, String city, String state, String zip) { /* ... */ }
```

- **Primitive Obsession** : Overusing primitive types to represent complex concepts; custom classes should be created to encapsulate these concepts.

Scenario: Using primitive types instead of small objects for simple tasks.

```java
public class Rectangle {
    private double width;
    private double height;

    public double calculateArea() {
        return width * height;
    }
}

// Instead of using a Dimension class like as below
public class Dimension {
    private double width;
    private double height;

    public Dimension(double width, double height) {
        this.width = width;
        this.height = height;
    }

    // Getters, setters, and other relevant methods
}

public class Rectangle {
    private Dimension dimension;

    public Rectangle(Dimension dimension) {
        this.dimension = dimension;
    }

    public double calculateArea() {
        return dimension.getWidth() * dimension.getHeight();
    }
}
```

- **Switch Statements** : Overreliance on switch or if-else structures; consider using polymorphism or design patterns as alternatives.

Scenario: Using a switch to determine behavior based on type.

```java
public double calculateDiscount(Customer customer) {
    switch (customer.getType()) {
        case "Regular":
            return 0.05;
        case "Premium":
            return 0.10;
        case "VIP":
            return 0.20;
        default:
            return 0;
    }
}
```

- **Parallel Inheritance Hierarchies** : Adding a subclass in one hierarchy necessitates adding a corresponding subclass in another hierarchy.

Scenario: Adding a new shape requires adding new classes in different hierarchies.

```java
// Shape hierarchy
public abstract class Shape { /* ... */ }
public class Circle extends Shape { /* ... */ }
public class Square extends Shape { /* ... */ }

// Renderer hierarchy
public abstract class ShapeRenderer { /* ... */ }
public class CircleRenderer extends ShapeRenderer { /* ... */ }
public class SquareRenderer extends ShapeRenderer { /* ... */ }

```

- **Lazy Class** : A class does too little to justify its existence; it should be merged with another class or removed.

Scenario: A class that doesn't do enough to justify its existence.

```java
public class HelperUtils {
   public static String toUpperCase(String input) {
       return input.toUpperCase();
   }
}
```

- **Speculative Generality** : Adding complexity for possible future needs, making the code harder to understand and maintain.

Scenario: Adding hooks and abstractions for future use cases that aren't needed yet.

```java
public interface DataProcessor {
   void processData(Map<String, Object> data);
}

public class JsonDataProcessor implements DataProcessor {
   @Override
   public void processData(Map<String, Object> data) {
       // Process JSON data
   }
}

// Only JSON processing is needed, but the abstraction is added prematurely.

```

- **Temporary Field** : Certain fields in an object have values only under specific conditions and are empty otherwise, increasing the difficulty of understanding the code.

Scenario: An object has fields that are only set under certain conditions.

```java
public class Order {
   private Discount couponDiscount; // Only used if a coupon is applied
   private Discount seasonalDiscount; // Only used during seasonal sales

   public double calculateTotal() {
       // Implementation
   }
}
```

- **Message Chains** : Chaining multiple method calls across objects, like a.b().c().d(), leading to high coupling and fragility.

Scenario: Code that navigates through multiple objects to get data.

```java
public class OrderService {
   public String getCustomerCity(Order order) {
       return order.getCustomer().getAddress().getCity();
   }
}
```

- **Middle Man** : A class where most methods simply delegate to methods in other classes, lacking substantial functionality.

Scenario: A class delegates most of its work to another class.

```java
public class CustomerManager {
   private CustomerDAO customerDAO = new CustomerDAO();

   public void addCustomer(Customer customer) {
       customerDAO.addCustomer(customer);
   }

   public Customer getCustomer(int id) {
       return customerDAO.getCustomer(id);
   }

   // Most methods just delegate to CustomerDAO
}
```

- **Inappropriate Intimacy** : Classes overly depend on each other's internal implementations, violating the principle of encapsulation.

Scenario: Two classes rely too heavily on each other's internal details.

```java
public class ClassA {
   private int secretValue;

   public int getSecretValue() {
       return secretValue;
   }
}

public class ClassB {
   public void doSomething(ClassA a) {
       int value = a.getSecretValue(); // Accessing internal details
       // Manipulate value
   }
}
```

- **Alternative Classes with Different Interfaces** : Classes perform similar functions but have different interfaces; interfaces should be unified or classes should be combined.

Scenario: Classes with similar functionality but different method signatures.

```java
public class XmlParser {
   public Document parseXml(String xml) { /* ... */ }
}

public class JsonParser {
   public JSONObject parse(String json) { /* ... */ }
}

// Interfaces are different despite similar purposes
```

- **Incomplete Library Class** : The library class in use doesn't fully meet the needs; it requires extension or wrapping.

Scenario: A library class doesn't provide necessary functionality.

```java
// Suppose the library's List doesn't have a sort method
List<Integer> numbers = new ArrayList<>();
// Need to write a custom sort
Collections.sort(numbers); // Library method is insufficient
```

- **Data Class** : A class contains only fields without behavior; it may need methods added or a redesign.

Scenario: A class with only fields and no methods (behavior).

```java
public class Point {
   public double x;
   public double y;
}

// No methods to manipulate or utilize the data

```

- **Refused Bequest** : A subclass inherits unwanted functionality from its parent class, violating the Liskov Substitution Principle.

Scenario: A subclass doesn't use inherited methods or overrides them improperly.

```java
public class Animal {
   public void eat() { /* ... */ }
   public void sleep() { /* ... */ }
}

public class RobotDog extends Animal {
   @Override
   public void eat() {
       // Doesn't need to eat; method is irrelevant
   }
}
```

- **Comments** : Excessive or unnecessary comments may indicate that the code is hard to understand; the code itself should be improved.

Scenario: Excessive comments that may indicate confusing code.

```java
public int calculate(int a, int b) {
   // Check if a is greater than b
   if (a > b) {
       // Subtract b from a
       return a - b;
   } else {
       // Add a and b
       return a + b;
   }
}
```
