Dependency Injection (DI) is an essential design pattern in many software architectures today. This chapter will explain the concept of DI and introduce its usage in .NET.

## A. Dependency Injection

Let's start by discussing the concepts of dependency and injection.

### a. Dependency

As the term suggests, 'dependency' means that objects in software often rely on each other. For example, imagine a calculator that needs to print the results. This calculator 'depends on' a printer. So, when you create a calculator, you also need to create a printer and give it to the calculator

![Object Reference](images/00/02/001.png)

```csharp
public class Calculator
{
    public Printer Printer {get;private set}
    public Add(int a, int b){
        var sum = a+b;
        Printer.ConsoleOut(sum);
    }
    public Calculator(Printer printer){
        Printer = printer;
    }
}
public class Printer
{
    public void ConsoleOut(string txt) 
    {
        Console.WriteLine(txt);
    }
}
static class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        var printer = new Printer();
        var calculator = new Calculator(printer);
        calculator.Add(1+1); 
    }
}
```

Because the Calculator relies on the Printer in this example, the control is not with the Printer. In other words, modifications to the Printer can have implications for the Calculator.

I found a fitting analogy online to illustrate object dependency. Imagine a teenager (let's call them '8+9') addicted to drugs. The '8+9' might believe they're in control and using drugs for their own pleasure. However, in reality, the '8+9's behavior is now controlled by the drug, making it impossible to break free.

### b. Dependency With Interface

How can we reduce dependency? A common approach is to make objects dependent on interfaces. By doing this, objects become decoupled, as illustrated in the diagram.

![Dependency With Interface](images/00/02/003.png)


```csharp
public class Calculator
{
    public IPrinter Printer {get;private set}
    public Add(int a, int b){
        var sum = a+b;
        Printer.ConsoleOut(sum);
    }
    public Calculator(IPrinter printer){
        Printer = printer;
    }
}
public class Printer:IPrinter
{
    public void ConsoleOut(string txt) 
    {
        Console.WriteLine(txt);
    }
}

public interface IPrinter{
    void ConsoleOut(string txt);
}

static class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        IPrinter printer = new Printer();
        var calculator = new Calculator(printer);
        calculator.Add(1+1); 
    }
}
```
The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) enables us to achieve loose coupling between modules. In this example, by depending on an interface rather than a concrete class, we can easily swap out the printer implementation for a text file output without affecting the higher-level component. This promotes code reusability and maintainability.

> The high-level module in this scenario is the Calculator, which is the caller, while the low-level module is the Printer, which is the callee.

Let's go back to the example of the "8+9". If we want to help them turn their life around and become a good young person, we can start by replacing their direct dependency on drugs with a dependency on medication, which acts as an interface.

![Dependency With Interface 8+9](images/00/02/004.png)

Let's say, hypothetically, we successfully replace the "8+9"'s drug dependency with a dependence on medication. Then, we'll create a "health food" category and secretly swap out the medication with actual health food. The "8+9" will think they're still taking their drugs, but in reality, they'll be consuming daily doses of nutritious food, leading to improved cognitive function, better posture, and even perfect test scores, transforming them into pillars of society.

### c. Injection

Let's talk about injection. In the Calculator example, we used constructor injection. Actually, injection is something we use all the time, but we might not notice it. There are three common injection patterns:

- Constructor Injection
- Property Injection
- Method Injection


#### Constructor Injection

```java
// Car interface
public interface ICar {
    // Method to start the car
    void run();
}

// Driver interface
public interface IDriver {
    // Method for the driver to drive a car
    void drive();
}

// Concrete implementation of the Driver interface
public class Driver implements IDriver {
    private ICar car;

    // Constructor injection: Injects the car object during object creation
    public Driver(ICar car) {
        this.car = car;
    }

    @Override
    public void drive() {
        car.run();
    }
}
```
#### Property Injection

```java
// Car interface
public interface ICar {
    // Method to start the car
    void run();
}

// Driver interface
public interface IDriver {
    // Method for the driver to drive a car
    void drive();
}

// Driver class with property injection
public class Driver implements IDriver {
    private ICar car;

    // Property injection: Injects the car object using a setter method
    public void setCar(ICar car) {
        this.car = car;
    }

    @Override
    public void drive() {
        car.run();
    }
}
```
#### Property Injection

```java
// Car interface
public interface ICar {
    // Method to start the car
    void run();
}

// Driver interface
public interface IDriver {
    // Method for the driver to drive a car
    void drive();
}


// Driver class with method injection
public interface IDriver {
    // Method for the driver to drive a car, taking the car object as a parameter
    void drive(ICar car);
}

public class Driver implements IDriver {
    @Override
    public void drive(ICar car) {
        car.run();
    }
}
```

After understanding Dependency and Injection, it should be clear that the dependency injection process involves placing the corresponding object into the instance object.

## B. Container Concept

After discussing the DI concept, let's move on to the container concept. In Section A, we mentioned the issue of dependencies. Although we can decouple objects using interfaces, in large-scale projects, the complexity and quantity of objects become more intricate. This is where the container mechanism comes into play.

 ![Container](images/00/02/005.png)

The concept of a container is to store all objects in a "box". When you need to use an object, you simply retrieve it from the box. It's like a golfer who carries a golf bag to store their clubs and has a caddy to assist them. Whenever the golfer needs a specific club, they just tell the caddy.

### a. Comparing "poor" and "rich" DI

After understanding dependency injection and containers, let's talk about the two main approaches: "poor man's DI" and "rich man's DI".

 - Poor man's DI means creating objects manually using the new keyword. This can be tedious and error-prone, especially when dealing with complex object graphs.

 - Rich man's DI involves using a DI container. This is like having a caddy in golf - the container manages the creation and lifetime of objects for you. You simply configure the container and it handles the rest.

## C. Ioc(Inversion of Control)

We'd all rather be rich than poor, right? That's why we use DI containers! When we use a DI container to manage our objects, we're essentially implementing inversion of control.

Simply put, if object A needs to use object B, traditionally A would create a new instance of B. But with a DI container, we hand over this responsibility to the container. Instead of A actively controlling the creation of B, the container takes care of it.

This is a great example of inversion of control. In web frameworks, for instance, the framework handles tasks like listening for HTTP requests and parsing them. As developers, we don't need to worry about these low-level details; the framework takes care of them for us.

> Inversion of Control (IoC) is a design pattern that shifts the control of object creation and lifecycle management to an external container or framework. Instead of a component directly controlling its dependencies, it receives them from an outside source.

## D. C# Dependency Injection Framework [[Example]](https://github.com/spyua/DIWindowsFormSample.git)

After discussing DI, containers, DIP, and IOC, we should now move on to the practical implementation. In .NET, there are two commonly used DI frameworks:

 - Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection 
 - Autofac

As mentioned above, there are three common injection methods (constructor, property, and method), which Autofac supports. However, ASP.NET DI currently only supports constructor injection. While most online examples focus on web applications, we will be using both DI tools for desktop Windows Forms in this context.

### Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection

DI configuration is set in DIServiceConfigure.cs.

#### The lifespan of injected services

Service lifetime specifies whether a new instance of a component is created on each request via dependency injection, or if a shared instance is used throughout the application. This behavior is controlled by the service's lifetime scope.

 - 1.AddSingleton 
 - 2.AddTransient 
 - 3.AddScoped 

 #### 1. AddSingleton

Only one instance of this object is created for the entire application and is shared among all parts of the application. In simpler terms, whenever different parts of the program need to use this object, they are always using the same exact object. It's similar to a static variable, but with the advantage of allowing object-oriented design and dependency injection.

The diagram below illustrates the lifetime of objects in ASP.NET DI, with object dependencies flowing from left to right.

 ![Singleton](images/00/02/006.png)

In our simulation scenario, we can map the objects as follows:

- Request: Button_Singleton_Click event
- First circle: Call LogController
- Second circle: Call LogRepository
- Instance: SingletonLogRepository

For the Repository injection, we use AddSingleton. To observe if the instances are indeed the same, we will generate a GUID when the object is instantiated.

```csharp
  // Use a singleton pattern for system-wide unique objects or when there are no concurrency or high-load request issues.
collection.AddSingleton<ISingletonLogRepository, LogRepository>();
```
When the Button_Singleton_Click button is pressed, both LogController and LogController2 will call the SingletonLogRepository object and print its GUID.

```csharp
private void Button_Singleton_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
	//var provider = DIServiceConfigure.GetProvider();
	//var logController = provider.GetRequiredService<ILogController>();
	var log = "Log1(Singleton):"+"UUID-"+LogController.OperationId("Singleton");
	var log2 = "Log2(Singleton):" + "UUID-" + LogController2.OperationId("Singleton");
	richTextBox_Info.AppendText(log+"\n");
	richTextBox_Info.AppendText(log2 + "\n");
	richTextBox_Info.AppendText(LogController.QueryLogCount());
}
```

We can observe that the two printed UUIDs are identical, indicating that the SingletonLogRepository instance is shared between the LogController and LogController2.

![Singleton Result](images/00/02/007.png)

 #### 2. AddTransient 

By definition, a new instance of the object, along with any of its dependent objects, is created every time a request for it is made within the application.

The diagram below depicts the lifecycle of objects within the ASP.NET Dependency Injection system. The dependencies between objects are represented from left to right.

![Transient](images/00/02/008.png)

In our simulation model, the objects can be mapped as follows:

 - Request: Triggered by the Button_Transient_Click event.
 - First node: Invokes the LogController.
 - Second node: Invokes the LogController2.
 - Instance: Utilizes a TransientLogRepository.

To implement the Repository injection, we employ AddTransient. In order to verify that distinct instances are created, we will generate a unique identifier (GUID) upon object instantiation.

 ```csharp
collection.AddTransient<ITransientLogRepository, LogRepository>();
 ```
For scenarios requiring asynchronous operations and a high volume of requests, using the Transient lifetime is recommended. However, simulating this in a simple Windows Forms application can be challenging.


When the Button_Transient_Click button is pressed, both LogController and LogController2 will call the SingletonLogRepository object and print its GUID.

 ```csharp
 private void Button_Transient_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
	// Simulate multiple requests
	//var provider = DIServiceConfigure.GetProvider();
	//var logController = provider.GetRequiredService<LogController>();
	//var log = "Log1(Transient):" + "UUID-" + logController.GUID.ToString();
	//richTextBox_Info.AppendText(log + "\n");

        // Simulate a single requests
	var log = "Log1(Transient):" + "UUID-" + LogController.OperationId("Transient");
	var log2 = "Log2(Transient):" + "UUID-" + LogController2.OperationId("Transient");
	richTextBox_Info.AppendText(log + "\n");
	richTextBox_Info.AppendText(log2 + "\n");

	//richTextBox_Info.AppendText(LogController.QueryLogCount());
}
 ```

We can see that the two printed UUIDs are different, indicating that the TransientLogRepository instances in Controller and Controller2 are distinct objects.

 ![Transient Result](images/00/02/009.png)

The above simulation example only demonstrates a single Request1 scenario. According to the definition, a new object is created every time a component is requested in the program. To simulate this, we have repeatedly clicked the button. To simulate multiple requests, we will uncomment the "multiple requests" block and comment out the "single request" code.

```csharp
private void Button_Transient_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
	// Simulate multiple requests
	var provider = DIServiceConfigure.GetProvider();
	var logController = provider.GetRequiredService<LogController>();
	var log = "Log1(Transient):" + "UUID-" + logController.GUID.ToString();
	richTextBox_Info.AppendText(log + "\n");

	// Simulate a single requests
	//var log = "Log1(Transient):" + "UUID-" + LogController.OperationId("Transient");
	//var log2 = "Log2(Transient):" + "UUID-" + LogController2.OperationId("Transient");
	//richTextBox_Info.AppendText(log + "\n");
	//richTextBox_Info.AppendText(log2 + "\n");

	//richTextBox_Info.AppendText(LogController.QueryLogCount());
}
```
The fact that the UUIDs are unique for every request proves that the Transient lifetime of the Controller is working as expected. Each time the container is asked to provide a Controller instance, a new one is created, ensuring that there are no shared state issues between different requests. This behavior is also observed for other dependencies registered with a transient lifetime.

![Transient Result 2](images/00/02/010.png)

 #### 3. AddScope 

The Scoped lifetime is arguably the most complex to understand. When visualizing the ASP.NET DI lifecycle, object dependencies are typically represented as a directed graph from left to right. A key characteristic of the Scoped lifetime is that within the boundaries of a single request, all components and their dependencies are resolved from the same scope, ensuring that they reference the same instances. Nevertheless, a new scope is initiated for each incoming request, guaranteeing that subsequent requests will receive fresh instances of these components.

![Scope](images/00/02/011.png)

In order to examine the behavior of multiple requests, we implemented a simulation by calling the Dialog method. The diagram below provides a visual representation of the experiment's outcomes. A notable observation is that the Instance property of each object...

 - SingletonLogRepository
 - TransientLogRepository
 - ScopedLogRepository

We can observe that within the same request flow, the ScopedLogRepository instances in LogController and LogService share the same UUID. However, when the dialog is opened a second time, the UUID becomes different from the first one. This behavior is distinct from that of a singleton. 

Additionally, we can see that the Transaction instances have unique UUIDs for each object and every request.

![Scope Result](images/00/02/012.png)

Differentiating between Scoped and Transient lifetimes can be tricky,  here's a simpler way to grasp their differences.

The Scoped lifetime is tied to a specific scope, usually a single request in web applications. Within that scope, the first instance of a component is created and reused for all dependencies as long as the scope is active. This ensures that all components within the same request share the same instance. Once the request is complete and the scope ends, the instance is disposed. For each new request, a new instance is created, ensuring no shared state between different requests.

On the other hand, the Transient lifetime creates a new instance of a component every time it's requested, regardless of scope. This means that even within the same request or operation, multiple calls to resolve the same component will result in entirely new instances, mimicking the behavior of traditional object creation using the new keyword. As a result, Transient components are more lightweight but don't share state across different parts of the application, even within a single request.


#### Summary of Dependency Injection Lifetimes

The concepts of Scoped, Singleton, and Transient lifetimes are crucial in understanding how dependency injection functions across different application architectures. In web applications, where the HTTP request lifecycle is relatively short, the Scoped lifetime is commonly used. This is because each HTTP request typically represents a distinct scope, allowing objects related to the request to be instantiated once and then disposed of at the end of the request. This helps ensure efficient resource management during the short-lived nature of web requests.

In contrast, Windows Forms applications often favor the Singleton lifetime. Due to the long-running nature of desktop applications, Singletons provide a convenient way to share state across the entire application without repeatedly creating new instances. The Scoped lifetime is less frequently applied in this context since there is no natural "request boundary" as seen in web applications. However, it can still be useful in specific cases where scoping is required for certain operations.

The Transient lifetime, which creates a new instance of a component each time it's requested, is commonly used for short-lived objects that don't need to be shared or reused. In many cases, such objects are disposed of immediately after use. While Transient lifetimes are useful, many developers prefer manual object creation using the "new" keyword, especially in scenarios where the overhead of dependency injection might not be necessary. This manual approach can sometimes offer more control over object instantiation and disposal.


#### Dynamic injection and swapping of dependencies

After discussing object lifetimes, let's move on to the concept of swapping concrete objects. In our example, we use the IPrinter interface to inject and swap between PrinterMethodA and PrinterMethodB.

Initially, PrinterMethodA is injected into IPrinter. When the button_Printer_Click button is pressed, the console outputs "MethodA Print: Printer Out".

![抽換](images/00/02/013.png)

Then, we replace PrinterMethodA with PrinterMethodB.

```csharp
collection.AddTransient<IPrinter, PrinterMethodB>();
```

Upon clicking the button_Printer_Click button, the console will display the message "MethodB Print: Printer Out".

![抽換2](images/00/02/014.png)

Additionally, we can inject a list of IPrinter instances by injecting multiple concrete implementations.

```csharp
collection.AddTransient<IPrinter, PrinterMethodA>();
collection.AddTransient<IPrinter, PrinterMethodB>();
```

We can inject multiple PrinterMethod methods for flexibility.

```csharp
private LogController LogController;
private LogController2 LogController2;

// Multiple injection
private IEnumerable<IPrinter> Printer;

public Form1(IEnumerable<IPrinter> printer,
			 LogController logController, 
			 LogController2 logController2)
{
	InitializeComponent();
	LogController = logController;
	LogController2 = logController2;
	// Multiple injection
	Printer = printer;
}
```

![抽換3](images/00/02/015.png)

Through altering the container configuration, we can dynamically replace all components that rely on the IPrinter interface, while keeping the main program's codebase unchanged. This demonstrates the power of dependency injection.

### AutoFac

The sample DI configuration is specified in AutofacConfig.cs.

Autofac and ASP.NET DI share a similar concept of lifetime scope, as illustrated in the table below [Source](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cesardelatorre/comparing-asp-net-core-ioc-service-life-times-and-autofac-ioc-instance-scopes/)


![Autofac](images/00/02/016.png)

As indicated in the mapping table, to transition from the sample program to an Autofac implementation, you merely need to comment out the .NET DI code within Bootstrapper and Form.cs and uncomment the associated Autofac code. This straightforward modification enables you to examine the distinct object lifetime behaviors governed by each dependency injection framework.
