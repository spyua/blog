# A deep dive into the usage of "var" 

I'm used to using 'var' in C# and found it very convenient. However, I know many people are against it because the implicit typing can significantly reduce code readability. If 'var' is really that bad, I don't think Java and .NET, two strongly-typed languages, would have adopted it. So I've done some research on this topic.

## 一、A brief explanation of "var"

The var keyword is used for implicit type declaration. Essentially, when you use var, you let the compiler infer the type of the variable. For example:

```csharp
var i = 10; // Inferred as int
var s = "hello"; // Inferred as string
```

Why use var instead of explicit types? The primary design intent of var was to simplify code and improve readability, especially in constructs like LINQ where it can reduce verbosity. However, the appropriateness of var can be context-dependent, as will be explored in subsequent sections.

## 二、Exploring usage scenarios

This chapter will delve into the suitable and unsuitable contexts for the application of var.

### a. Simplicity

Imagine you're using a long and complex type name, like Dictionary<int, List<string>>. If you had to write out this entire type name every time you declared a variable, your code would quickly become cluttered and time-consuming. The same applies to long object declarations, such as Google Cloud's KMS Package KeyManagementServiceClient.

#### I.A suitable application of LINQ

Let's take .NET Core LINQ as an example to illustrate the benefits of using var for complex types. Imagine you have a list named users, where each element is an instance of a User class. You want to select all users whose age is greater than 20.

Without using var, you would need to write:

```csharp
IEnumerable<User> usersAbove20 = users.Where(u => u.Age > 20);
```

However, if your query becomes more complex and the return type is more intricate, for instance, you want to extract the names and ages of these users and then sort them. In this case, you would need to write:

```csharp
IOrderedEnumerable<AnonymousType1> result = users.Where(u => u.Age > 20)
                                                 .Select(u => new { u.Name, u.Age })
                                                 .OrderBy(u => u.Age);
```

In contrast, using var simplifies this significantly:

```csharp
var result = users.Where(u => u.Age > 20)
                  .Select(u => new { u.Name, u.Age })
                  .OrderBy(u => u.Age);
```

In this code snippet, it will be an anonymous type as follows:

![Object Reference](images/00/07/001.png)

An anonymous type is a type without an explicit name. It's primarily used to store temporary, simple data structures. In the LINQ world, when you need to extract specific information from a complex data structure but don't want to define a new class, you often use var, making the operation much simpler. The key point here is that it's ideal for data transition operations, especially when you don't need to store or reuse a specific data structure for an extended period.

Let's take another example: a task that involves processing data from various sources (databases, APIs, user input, etc.). You'll need to work with multiple types, collections, and use lambda expressions with var.

```csharp
var query = dataContext.Customers
              .Where(c => c.Age > 18)
              .SelectMany(c => c.Orders, (c, o) => new { c.Name, o.OrderId, o.Amount })
              .GroupBy(x => x.Name)
              .Select(g => new { Customer = g.Key, TotalAmount = g.Sum(x => x.Amount) });
```

Without using var, it would look like this:

```csharp
IEnumerable<IGrouping<string, anonymousType<string, int, decimal>>> query = 
      dataContext.Customers
                 .Where(c => c.Age > 18)
                 .SelectMany(c => c.Orders, (c, o) => new { c.Name, o.OrderId, o.Amount })
                 .GroupBy(x => x.Name)
                 .Select(g => new { Customer = g.Key, TotalAmount = g.Sum(x => x.Amount) });
```

In this example, not using var makes the type very explicit, but at the cost of making the code overly verbose and difficult to read.

#### II.Good use cases for overly long object names: 

Lambda syntax sugar is ubiquitous in many languages. Another common scenario involves var being used to declare variables with lengthy object names. For instance, consider the following example of an asymmetric decryption method encapsulated in Google Cloud KMS:

In this example, the object naming conventions clearly delineate the process:

 - Creating a keyManagementServiceClient
 - Generating a cryptoKeyVersionName
 - Decoding cryptoKeyVersionName into bytes
 - Initiating asymmetric decryption
 - Returning the result

```csharp
@Override
  public String asymmetricDecrypt(KeyInfoDto keyInfo, String ciphertext) throws IOException {
    try (KeyManagementServiceClient keyManagementServiceClient = KeyManagementServiceClient.create()) {

       // Generate the crypto key version name based on the provided key information
      CryptoKeyVersionName cryptoKeyVersionName  = generateCryptoKeyVersionName(keyInfo);

       // Decode the base64-encoded ciphertext into a byte array
      byte[] decryptedBytes = decodeBase64ToBytes(ciphertext);

       // Perform asymmetric decryption using the specified crypto key version
      AsymmetricDecryptResponse asymmetricDecryptResponse = keyManagementServiceClient.asymmetricDecrypt(cryptoKeyVersionName, ByteString.copyFrom(decryptedBytes));

      // Convert the decrypted bytes to a UTF-8 string and return it
      return asymmetricDecryptResponse.getPlaintext().toStringUtf8();
    }
  }
```

If we were to replace the code with var, we could ask ourselves: does this affect readability? Actually, no. On the contrary, for declaring type objects, it seems more concise. However, the key point is that as long as the naming is clear, long object names won't hinder readability. Unless you're unsure about the type of a particular part of the flow and want to understand it, you can use your IDE to hover over it for more information.


```csharp
@Override
  public String asymmetricDecrypt(KeyInfoDto keyInfo, String ciphertext) throws IOException {
    try (var keyManagementServiceClient = KeyManagementServiceClient.create()) {

      // Generate the crypto key version name based on the provided key information
      var cryptoKeyVersionName  = generateCryptoKeyVersionName(keyInfo);

      // Decode the base64-encoded ciphertext into a byte array
      byte[] decryptedBytes = decodeBase64ToBytes(ciphertext);

      // Perform asymmetric decryption using the specified crypto key version
      var asymmetricDecryptResponse = keyManagementServiceClient.asymmetricDecrypt(cryptoKeyVersionName, ByteString.copyFrom(decryptedBytes));

      // Convert the decrypted bytes to a UTF-8 string and return it
      return asymmetricDecryptResponse.getPlaintext().toStringUtf8();
    }
  }
```
I think the above example doesn't strongly convey the point. Let's consider a code snippet for RSA encryption using a specified DER-formatted public key (derKeyBytes). In this example, we'll use var throughout the entire process:

1. Reading the public key: x509EncodedKeySpec = new X509EncodedKeySpec(derKeyBytes); This line reads the DER-formatted public key data.

2. Generating an RSA public key object: Using the public key data, an RSA public key object is created.

3. Initializing the cipher: A specific RSA encryption mode and padding scheme is chosen, determined by Cipher.getInstance("RSA/ECB/OAEPWithSHA-256AndMGF1Padding");.

4. Setting parameters: In this example, OAEP (Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding) and SHA-256 are used as the hash algorithm.

5. Encryption: rsaCipher.doFinal(plaintext.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8)); This line converts the plaintext to a byte array and encrypts it.

6. Returning the result: The encrypted data is converted to a Base64-encoded string and returned.

As you can see, even with var, readability is not compromised, especially when names are chosen well. In fact, it simplifies the declaration of lengthy object names, making the code more concise and easier to read.

```csharp
/**
   * Encrypts the given plaintext using the specified DER-encoded public key.
   *
   * @param plaintext    The plaintext to be encrypted.
   * @param derKeyBytes  The DER-encoded public key as a byte array.
   * @return             The Base64-encoded ciphertext.
   * @throws InvalidKeySpecException  If there is an error in the key specification.
   */
  private String encryptUsingPublicKey(String plaintext, byte[] derKeyBytes) throws InvalidKeySpecException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, NoSuchPaddingException, InvalidKeyException, InvalidAlgorithmParameterException, IllegalBlockSizeException, BadPaddingException {
    var x509EncodedKeySpec = new X509EncodedKeySpec(derKeyBytes);

     // Generate an RSA public key object from the DER-encoded key
    var rsaPublicKey  = KeyFactory.getInstance("RSA").generatePublic(x509EncodedKeySpec);

    // Initialize the cipher with RSA/ECB/OAEPWithSHA-256AndMGF1Padding mode
    var rsaCipher = Cipher.getInstance("RSA/ECB/OAEPWithSHA-256AndMGF1Padding");
    var oaepParameters = new OAEPParameterSpec("SHA-256", "MGF1"
            , MGF1ParameterSpec.SHA256, PSource.PSpecified.DEFAULT);
    rsaCipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, rsaPublicKey , oaepParameters );

     // Encrypt the plaintext using the initialized cipher
    byte[] encryptedData  = rsaCipher.doFinal(plaintext.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8));
    return encodeBase64ToString(encryptedData);
  }
```

For comparison, let's look at a control group that uses strong typing. By reading the following code, you'll immediately feel that it's slightly harder to read compared to the previous example.

```csharp
/**
   * Encrypts the given plaintext using the specified DER-encoded public key.
   *
   * @param plaintext    The plaintext to be encrypted.
   * @param derKeyBytes  The DER-encoded public key as a byte array.
   * @return             The Base64-encoded ciphertext.
   * @throws InvalidKeySpecException  If there is an error in the key specification.
   */
  private String encryptUsingPublicKey(String plaintext, byte[] derKeyBytes) throws InvalidKeySpecException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, NoSuchPaddingException, InvalidKeyException, InvalidAlgorithmParameterException, IllegalBlockSizeException, BadPaddingException {
    X509EncodedKeySpec x509EncodedKeySpec = new X509EncodedKeySpec(derKeyBytes);

    // Generate an RSA public key object from the DER-encoded key
    PublicKey rsaPublicKey  = KeyFactory.getInstance("RSA").generatePublic(x509EncodedKeySpec);

     // Initialize the cipher with RSA/ECB/OAEPWithSHA-256AndMGF1Padding mode
    Cipher rsaCipher = Cipher.getInstance("RSA/ECB/OAEPWithSHA-256AndMGF1Padding");
    OAEPParameterSpec oaepParameters = new OAEPParameterSpec("SHA-256", "MGF1"
            , MGF1ParameterSpec.SHA256, PSource.PSpecified.DEFAULT);
    rsaCipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, rsaPublicKey , oaepParameters );

    // Encrypt the plaintext using the initialized cipher
    byte[] encryptedData  = rsaCipher.doFinal(plaintext.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8));
    return encodeBase64ToString(encryptedData);
  }
```

#### III. Negative use cases: 

After discussing the benefits of concise code using var, let's explore some inappropriate use cases. Consider the following test code snippet for symmetric and asymmetric encryption/decryption: we want to compare encrypt and decrypt. In this scenario, if we use var, it becomes ambiguous whether we are comparing String or byte[]. In contexts where data types need to be explicitly defined, using var is not suitable.

```csharp
// Set a test plaintext string
String testPlaintext ="PAL";
// Create a KeyInfoDto object to hold key information
var keyInfoDto = new KeyInfoDto();

keyInfoDto.setProjectId("affable-cacao-389805");
keyInfoDto.setLocationId("asia-east1");
keyInfoDto.setKeyRingId("cathy-sample-project");
keyInfoDto.setKeyVersion("1");

// Test symmetric encryption and decryption using the KMS service
// Set the key ID to use for encryption and decryption
keyInfoDto.setKeyId("kms-sdk-testing");
// Encrypt the plaintext using the specified key
var encrypt = kmsService.symmetricEncrypt(keyInfoDto,testPlaintext);
// Decrypt the ciphertext using the same key
var decrypt = kmsService.symmetricDecrypt(keyInfoDto,encrypt);
// Verify that the decrypted text matches the original plaintext
Assert.hasText(decrypt,testPlaintext);
```

Therefore, in certain situations, declaring variables with var is not appropriate. For example,

 - Cross-platform or multilingual integration:
    -  If your backend microservices need to interact with other platforms or services written in different languages, explicit typing makes it easier for other developers to understand the code.

    ```csharp
    // It's inappropriate to use 'var' because other developers or platforms need to know the exact data type.
    HttpResponse<String> response = client.send(request, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString());
    ```

 - Easily confused types:
    - Using "var" can lead to confusion when handling two or more similar but not identical types.

    ```csharp
    // Explicit typing can prevent confusion between BigDecimal and BigInteger.
    BigDecimal bigDecimal = new BigDecimal("10.0");
    BigInteger bigInteger = new BigInteger("10");
    ```

 - Mathematical operation: 
    - Using "var" can also cause problems when performing mathematical calculations. For example:

    ```csharp
    // Is it an int or a double?
    var result = 10 / 2;
    ```

 - Unclear initialization value
    - When the initial value doesn't provide enough type information, using "var" can make the type ambiguous.

    ```csharp
    // Should I use List<String> or ArrayList<String>, or something else?
    var names = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob");
    ```


 - Unit testing and data validation, exemplified by encrypt and decrypt functions
    - Explicitly defined variable types in unit tests enhance code readability and make it easier to understand the expected behavior of the code under test.

    ```csharp
    // It is required to assert that the getResult method returns a List object in our test case.
    List<String> result = someObject.getResult();
    ```


 - foreach
    - Using var in a foreach loop can be less readable, particularly when the collection contains elements of different types or when the code is complex.

    ```csharp
    List<DetailedOrder> orders = GetOrders();

    // Use explicit typing
    foreach (DetailedOrder order in orders)
    {
        // ...
    }

    // use var
    foreach (var order in orders)
    {
        // ...
    }
    ```

Therefore, in situations where explicit data types are required to enhance code readability and maintainability, especially when dealing with cross-platform interactions, ambiguous types, mathematical operations, unclear initialization values, unit testing, and data validation, using **var** is often not the best choice.

### b. Follow guidelines for using meaningful names

When you use var to declare a variable, the variable's type isn't explicitly stated in the code. To help both yourself and others understand the variable's purpose more quickly, you're encouraged to give it a more descriptive name.

```csharp
List<Student> list = new List<Student>();
```

Here, you might simply name the variable **`list`** since the type **`List<Student>`** already tells you that it's a list of students.

However, if you use **`var`**:


```csharp
var students = new List<Student>();
```

At this point, you might opt for a more descriptive name like students to clearly indicate that this variable is used to store student data. Even without the explicit type in the code, the variable name students immediately conveys its purpose.

However, the effectiveness of using var largely depends on the developer's adherence to clean code principles. If a developer doesn't understand clean code practices, using var can lead to significant code readability issues.


## 三、Summary of var Usage:

- **Code Conciseness**: **`var`** can make code more concise, especially when dealing with long type names.
- **Type Inference**: **`var`** is necessary for anonymous types, such as Linq query results.
- **Readability**: In some cases, avoiding repetitive type names can improve code readability.
- **Ambiguous Types**: If the initialization expression doesn't clearly indicate the type, using **`var`** can lead to confusion about the variable's actual type.
- **Overuse**: Excessive use of **`var`** without considering the context can make code harder to maintain and understand.

Using **`var`** can enhance code readability and flexibility, particularly when handling anonymous or dynamic types. However, developers should use var judiciously and ensure that the code's intent remains clear.
