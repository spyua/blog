# Pattern-Strategy

## Introduction

Recently, I've begun to organize the design patterns I've previously utilized. Among these patterns, the Strategy pattern is a common one, categorized under Behavioral Patterns.

> Behavioral design patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

The Strategy pattern is generally applied in scenarios where methods vary in their implementation. In such cases, an interface is declared, and different objects implement this interface. When there's a need to change the implementation method, it can be directly swapped within the Context, or the change can be made directly through Dependency Injection (DI). This approach facilitates flexible and interchangeable behavior within software components.

## Usage Context

Recently, while working on national instrument communication, I encountered a piece of code that initially used GPIB for communication. Later on, USB communication was added. GPIB communication utilized the MessageBasedSession Class from NI's VISA DLL files, whereas USB communication employed the Device Class from NI's N4882 DLL files.

In the past, when writing structured programs, my instinct was to directly use a variable to switch between communication methods, as shown in the 5th line of the program below. This resulted in having to perform a check in every method (lines 29, 43). If a new communication method, such as TCP, were to be added at this point, it would require significant adjustments to the NormalBaseDevice (every function would need to be modified).


```csharp
public class NormalBaseDevice
{

    private bool IsGpib;

    // Gpib Com
    MessageBasedSession GpibCom;
    
    // Usb Com
    Device UsbCom;
    
    public NormalBaseDevice(bool isGPIB)
    {

        IsGpib = isGPIB;

            if (isGPIB)
            {
                GpibCom = new MessageBasedSession();
            }
            else
            {
                UsbCom = new Device();
            }

        }

        public string Write(string cmd)
        {

            if (IsGpib)
            {
                return GpibCom.Write(cmd);
            }
            else
            {
                return UsbCom.Write(cmd);
            }

        }

        public int Read()
        {

            if (IsGpib)
            {
                return GpibCom.Read();
            }
            else
            {
                return UsbCom.Read();
            }

        }

    }
```

This approach results in all communication methods being tightly coupled together, making any adjustments inevitably impactful. At this point, we can use an interface to achieve separation, allowing each communication method to implement the interface. Adjustments can then be made directly in the Context.

First, we declare an IStrategy interface, with the interface methods for Write and Read as follows:

```csharp
public interface IStrategy
{
    string Write(string cmd);

    int Read();
}
```
Next, we write the GpibCom and UsbCom concrete classes and implement the IStrategy methods.

```csharp
public class GpibCom : IStrategy
{
    private MessageBasedSession Device;

    public GpibCom()
    {
        Device = new MessageBasedSession();
    }

    public string Write(string cmd)
    {
        return Device.Write(cmd);
         
    }

    public int Read()
    {
        return Device.Read();
    }
}
```

```csharp
 public class UsbCom : IStrategy
{
    private Device Device;

    public UsbCom()
    {
        Device = new Device();
    }

    public string Write(string cmd)
    {
        return Device.Write(cmd);
    }

    public int Read()
    {
        return Device.Read();
    }
}
```
At this point, within the Context, we can freely swap to the method we need, as shown below:

```csharp
class Program
{
     static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        IStrategy com;
        
        com = new GpibCom();
        var cmd = com.Write(Action);
        
        com = new UsbCom();
        var cmd = com.Write(Action);
        
    }
}
```
Additionally, it's common to pair the Strategy pattern with a simple factory to encapsulate the switch for selecting which object to instantiate, as shown below:

```csharp
public class ComFacotry
{
    public enum ComType { Gpib, Usb}

    public static IStrategy CreateCom(ComType type)
    {
        IStrategy com;

        switch (type)
        {
            case ComType.Gpib:
                com = new GpibCom();
                break;
                
            default:
                com = new UsbCom();
                break;

        }

        return com;
    }
}
```
The use of Context then becomes:

```csharp
class Program
{
     static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        var usbCom = ComFacotry.CreateCom(ComType.Usb);
        var cmd = usbCom.Write(Action);
    }
}
```
