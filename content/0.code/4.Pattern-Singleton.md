# Pattern-Singleton

## Introduction

Recently, I began organizing and documenting the design patterns I've used before. The Singleton pattern is one of the more frequently used patterns, categorized under Creational Patterns.

> Creational Patterns: Creational patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

 The Singleton pattern is among the commonly used design patterns, falling under the category of Creational Patterns. Creational patterns provide various mechanisms for creating objects, enhancing flexibility and reuse of existing code.

A Singleton object is instantiated automatically in memory upon the program's startup, similar to the commonly seen Static Method. This method can be used without needing to be created explicitly.

## Context Usage

 - Static Method
 - Static Object Definition

For instance, if we're looking to implement a certain static method, we typically use the static keyword. For example, it's common in systems to declare shared configuration variables that are read from a config file. This approach allows these variables to be accessed globally without creating an instance of the class. The Singleton pattern can be applied to ensure that only one instance of the configuration settings is created and shared across the system, enhancing consistency and preventing potential issues from multiple instantiations.

```csharp
//Static Method
 public class StaticAppSetting
{
    public static readonly string AppName = GetConfigValue("AppName");

    public static string GetConfigValue(string value)
    {
        return ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[value];
    }
}

// Context
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(StaticAppSetting.AppName);
    }
}
```
Using static methods allows us to easily implement shared static functionality, which is more commonly utilized in structured programming. However, if we want to incorporate object-oriented concepts, such as inheritance and interfaces, relying solely on static methods won't meet our needs for object-oriented design.

When implementing the Singleton pattern, typically two key actions are undertaken:

 - Creating a static private field (INSTANCE): This field holds the singleton instance. You implement logic to check whether this field is null. If it is, a new instance of the class is created. This ensures that only one instance of the class exists within the application at any time. Additionally, the constructor of the class is made private or inaccessible to prevent external instantiation.

 - Creating a public static method or property to access the instance: This method or property provides a global access point to the singleton instance. It checks if the INSTANCE field is null; if so, it initializes the instance. If not, it returns the existing instance. This method ensures that the class adheres to the singleton property, providing a single, globally accessible instance throughout the application.

Online content can be presented in various styles, and currently, the method my friend shared is considered the most elegant as described below.

```csharp
//Singleton Pattern
public class SingletonAppSetting
{
    //Instance Method
    private static class SingletonHolder
    {
        static SingletonHolder() { }
        internal static readonly SingletonAppSetting INSTANCE = new SingletonAppSetting();
    }
    
    // Instance Field
    public static SingletonAppSetting Instance { get { return SingletonHolder.INSTANCE; } }

    public readonly string AppName;
 
    // Construct
    protected SingletonAppSetting()
    {
        AppName = GetConfigValue("AppName");
    }

    public string GetConfigValue(string value)
    {
        return ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[value];
    }
}

// Context
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
         Console.WriteLine(SingletonAppSetting.Instance.AppName);
    }
}
```

If we have another system that we want to adapt, which involves network-related settings, we can revise it by using a static approach. One method is to add a new static class, and the other is to modify the existing static class as follows.

```csharp
 public class StaticAppSetting
{
    public static readonly string AppName = GetConfigValue("AppName");

    public static readonly string LocalIp = GetConfigValue("LocalIp");
        
    public static readonly string LocalPort = GetConfigValue("LocalPort");

    public static string GetConfigValue(string value)
    {
            return ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[value];
    }
}
```

If using the Singleton pattern, you can declare a new InternetAppSetting object that inherits from the original AppSetting as follows.

```csharp
public class SingletonInternetAppSetting : SingletonAppSetting
{
    private static class SingletonHolder
    {
        static SingletonHolder() { }
        internal static readonly SingletonInternetAppSetting INSTANCE = new SingletonInternetAppSetting();
    }
    public static new SingletonInternetAppSetting Instance { get { return SingletonHolder.INSTANCE; } }

    public readonly string LocalIp;
    public readonly string LocalPort;

    protected SingletonInternetAppSetting()
    {
        LocalIp = GetConfigValue("LocalIp");
        LocalPort = GetConfigValue("LocalPort");
    }
}

//Context
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(SongletonInternetAppSetting.Instance.AppName);
        Console.WriteLine(SongletonInternetAppSetting.Instance.LocalIp);
        Console.WriteLine(SongletonInternetAppSetting.Instance.LocalPort);
    }
}
```

Additionally, we can utilize an interface to work with the Singleton method. For instance, we can declare an ISetting interface.

```csharp
public interface ISetting
{
    string GetConfigValue(string value);
}
```
Have the object implement the interface.

>  public class SingletonAppSetting : ISetting 
 public class SingletonInternetAppSetting : ISetting

This would then allow for direct substitution of the implementation in the context of use.

```csharp
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        ISetting appSetting = SingletonAppSetting.Instance;
        var valueFromConfig = appSetting.GetConfigValue("Value");

        appSetting = SongletonInternetAppSetting.Instance;
        var valueFromIni = appSetting.GetConfigValue("Value");
    }
}
```
