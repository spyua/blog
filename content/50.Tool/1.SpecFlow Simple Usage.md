# SpecFlow Usage

I need to share about TDD (Test-Driven Development) soon, and it reminded me of my notes from a BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) course I took. The course taught the concept of BDD and included some hands-on practice. However, for the C# implementation, it didn't utilize SpecFlow to edit DSL (Domain-Specific Language) syntax to map to the output code. So, I decided to give it a try on my own. There are quite a few articles about its usage online, but they mostly cover the simplest contexts. Coincidentally, the course provided an example that was a bit closer to real-world implementation for me to experiment with. I encountered some issues along the way, so I thought I'd jot down a brief record.

## BDD 

### Simple Concept

BDD focuses on the behavior and requirements of software throughout the development process. It emphasizes the use of natural language (close to human-understandable language) to describe the behavior that software should exhibit. This approach enables developers, testers, and non-technical stakeholders (such as product managers and business analysts) to clearly understand the requirements.

### The difference between BDD and TDD

#### TDD

For TDD, or Test-Driven Development, let's say we're adding a feature to a calculator program to perform addition:

 1. Write a test case to simulate the addition feature (for example, testing that 2 + 3 equals 5).

 2. Write the actual addition functionality in the program.

 3. Run the test.

 4. If the test fails (which it likely will initially), refactor the code.

 5. Run the test again. Continue the cycle of testing and refactoring until the test passes.

 This TDD cycle ensures that the addition functionality works as expected before moving on to develop other features, ensuring each part of the program is tested and functional in isolation.

#### BDD

 For BDD, or Behavior-Driven Development, the process focuses on the expected behavior of the addition functionality in a calculator program, described in natural language. Here’s how it might look:

 1. Describe the expected behavior of the addition functionality in natural language. For example: "When the user inputs two numbers and presses the 'add' button, the application should display the sum of these two numbers."

 2. Write functional tests to check the addition feature, typically using a BDD testing framework (like Cucumber or SpecFlow) that allows behavior descriptions in natural language.

 3. Implement the actual addition functionality in the program.

 4. Execute the tests to ensure they pass, verifying that the program behaves as expected according to the described behaviors.

 5. Refactor as needed while ensuring the tests still pass.

 This BDD approach emphasizes clear communication and understanding among all stakeholders (developers, testers, and non-technical roles) about what the software is expected to do, ensuring the development aligns closely with user needs and expectations.

 #### Simple Summary

 The core idea of TDD, or Test-Driven Development, is to write tests before implementing features. Developers begin by writing test cases for a function or module, and then they write the corresponding code to make those test cases pass. The focus is on testing individual functions or methods. In contrast, BDD, or Behavior-Driven Development, focuses on the behavior of an entire feature or system. In BDD, test cases are closer to user requirements, which helps improve communication and understanding between the development team and non-technical stakeholders.

## Practice using SpecFlow  ([Test Context](https://github.com/spyua/BDD-Test-For-Net.git))

### Step1: Install SpecFlow
 
 - Install SpecFlow in Visual Studio IDE (navigate to Extensions and Updates to install, and remember to restart the IDE afterwards).
 - Create a new NUnit project.
 - For the test project, install SpecFlow.NUnit from NuGet (be mindful of the NuGet package name).

### Step 2: Add a feature file to the test project, and edit it to include User Stories and Scenarios.

Add a feature file and edit the Feature section to include a User Story.

```
Feature: Add item to cart
    In order to avoid the wrong total price
    As a Customer
    I want to get the current total price of items in the cart
```

> A User Story is a type of scenario description that outlines a user's requirements for an application. It consists of three elements: Role, Feature, and Priority. For example, "As a user, I want to be able to add products to my shopping cart"; Priority indicates the importance of each feature, usually represented by a number, with 1 being the highest priority. This User Story template, composed of Role, Feature, and Priority, often follows the format "As a (role), I want (feature), so that (benefit)". This format helps teams better define and understand system requirements.

```
Scenario: Calculate the total price for cart items
    Given there are cart items
    When the customer completes the order
    Then the total price should be the sum of the subtotal of all the cart items plus shipping fee NTD 60

Scenario: Alert customer when adding too many items
    Given there are five items in the cart
    When the customer tries to add one more item
    Then the system should alert the customer not to do so and indicate which item cannot be added

Scenario: Alert customer when exceeding purchase limit
    Given the customer has added a quantity of items to the cart
    When the quantity of items exceeds the purchase limit
    Then the system should alert the customer and indicate that the item has reached its purchase limit

Scenario: Apply free shipping for orders over 500
    Given the customer selects the cart items
    When the total price is over 500
    Then the customer should receive free shipping
```
A Scenario is a descriptive statement used to outline the behavior of a specific feature. It often uses the "Given-When-Then" syntax to detail how software should behave under certain conditions. Scenarios serve as readable and understandable requirement specifications, helping developers and non-technical team members reach a consensus. Suppose we have a shopping website; we could write the following Scenario for the "add a product to the shopping cart" feature:

```
Scenario: 用戶將產品添加到購物車
  Given 用戶已登錄購物網站
  And 用戶瀏覽一個產品頁面
  When 用戶點擊“添加到購物車”按鈕
  Then 產品應該被添加到購物車中
  And 購物車內的產品數量應該增加
```

### Step 3: Generate the Test Code Framework

Right-click on the feature file and select "Define Step." This action will automatically generate the test code framework for you, with names following the descriptions in the BDD Scenario.

### Step 4: After completing the example, directly run the test.

## Points to Note

### Generating code results in anomalies.

When generating code using "Define" in a multi-scenario context, it's common to encounter issues where code for some scenarios isn't generated. The most frequent issue is missing code for certain scenarios. When a description fails to generate code successfully, it will turn purple as shown below.

Possible solutions include:

 1. Rewrite the description. It's recommended to use ChatGPT 4.0 for assistance in generating descriptions. This can be especially helpful for those who are not proficient in English or unfamiliar with using SpecFlow, as it can be challenging to describe scenarios in a way that SpecFlow can recognize.

 2. Right-click on the purple-highlighted sentences and choose "Define." There is a "Copy" option to manually paste it. This method is the quickest.

### Multi Scenario Object Initialization Using SharedContext Approach

If a Feature has multiple Scenarios and you need to initialize objects, you can use the SharedContext approach. The approach is demonstrated with the provided example scenario below.

```csharp
// Declare the objects to be used with SharedContext.
public class SharedContext
{
    public Action addToCart;
    public Cart Cart { get; set; }
    public CardItem Erasier { get; set; }
    public CardItem Pencial { get; set; }
    public CardItem BluePen { get; set; }
    public CardItem Ruler { get; set; }
    public CardItem Notebook { get; set; }
    public CardItem PencilSharpener { get; set; }
}
```


```csharp
// Perform the following injection settings in the test object
private readonly SharedContext _sharedContext;

public AddItemToCartStepDefinitions(SharedContext sharedContext)
{
    _sharedContext = sharedContext;
}

[BeforeScenario]
public void Setup()
{
    _sharedContext.Cart = new Cart();
    _sharedContext.Erasier = new CardItem(name: "Erasiers", unitPrice: 10, maxPurchaseQty: 10);
    _sharedContext.Pencial = new CardItem(name: "Pencial", unitPrice: 20, maxPurchaseQty: 10);
    _sharedContext.BluePen = new CardItem(name: "BluePen", unitPrice: 30, maxPurchaseQty: 10);
    _sharedContext.Ruler = new CardItem(name: "Ruler", unitPrice: 30, maxPurchaseQty: 10);
    _sharedContext.Notebook = new CardItem(name: "Notebook", unitPrice: 50, maxPurchaseQty: 5);
    _sharedContext.PencilSharpener = new CardItem(name: "PencilSharpener", unitPrice: 50, maxPurchaseQty: 5);
}
```

Then, directly use the _sharedContext object in the test code.
