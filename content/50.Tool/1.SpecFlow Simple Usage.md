# SpecFlow Usage

I need to share about TDD (Test-Driven Development) soon, and it reminded me of my notes from a BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) course I took. The course taught the concept of BDD and included some hands-on practice. However, for the C# implementation, it didn't utilize SpecFlow to edit DSL (Domain-Specific Language) syntax to map to the output code. So, I decided to give it a try on my own. There are quite a few articles about its usage online, but they mostly cover the simplest contexts. Coincidentally, the course provided an example that was a bit closer to real-world implementation for me to experiment with. I encountered some issues along the way, so I thought I'd jot down a brief record.

## BDD 

### Simple Concept

BDD focuses on the behavior and requirements of software throughout the development process. It emphasizes the use of natural language (close to human-understandable language) to describe the behavior that software should exhibit. This approach enables developers, testers, and non-technical stakeholders (such as product managers and business analysts) to clearly understand the requirements.

### The difference between BDD and TDD

#### TDD

For TDD, or Test-Driven Development, let's say we're adding a feature to a calculator program to perform addition:

 1. Write a test case to simulate the addition feature (for example, testing that 2 + 3 equals 5).

 2. Write the actual addition functionality in the program.

 3. Run the test.

 4. If the test fails (which it likely will initially), refactor the code.

 5. Run the test again. Continue the cycle of testing and refactoring until the test passes.

 This TDD cycle ensures that the addition functionality works as expected before moving on to develop other features, ensuring each part of the program is tested and functional in isolation.

#### BDD

 For BDD, or Behavior-Driven Development, the process focuses on the expected behavior of the addition functionality in a calculator program, described in natural language. Hereâ€™s how it might look:

 1. Describe the expected behavior of the addition functionality in natural language. For example: "When the user inputs two numbers and presses the 'add' button, the application should display the sum of these two numbers."

 2. Write functional tests to check the addition feature, typically using a BDD testing framework (like Cucumber or SpecFlow) that allows behavior descriptions in natural language.

 3. Implement the actual addition functionality in the program.

 4. Execute the tests to ensure they pass, verifying that the program behaves as expected according to the described behaviors.

 5. Refactor as needed while ensuring the tests still pass.

 This BDD approach emphasizes clear communication and understanding among all stakeholders (developers, testers, and non-technical roles) about what the software is expected to do, ensuring the development aligns closely with user needs and expectations.

 #### Simple Summary

 The core idea of TDD, or Test-Driven Development, is to write tests before implementing features. Developers begin by writing test cases for a function or module, and then they write the corresponding code to make those test cases pass. The focus is on testing individual functions or methods. In contrast, BDD, or Behavior-Driven Development, focuses on the behavior of an entire feature or system. In BDD, test cases are closer to user requirements, which helps improve communication and understanding between the development team and non-technical stakeholders.
